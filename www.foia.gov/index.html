      text: Before making a request it is important that you identify the correct agency where your request should be sent. The Freedom of Information Act is administered on a decentralized basis, meaning each of over 100 agencies is responsible for receiving, processing, and responding to its own FOIA requests. The resources on this website are designed to assist you in this process.

Systems of Records Notices can help you identify the types of records an agency maintains and the way they are maintained to help you choose which agency to send your request to. It can also help you tailor your request in order to get the precise records you are looking for quickly.  There are several resources to assist you in this research.  First, each agency has a FOIA Reference Guide, which has a wealth information about making requests to that agency, including a description of the agencyâ€™s major information and record locator systems. Additionally, under the Privacy Act of 1974, agencies must publish in the Federal Register certain systems of records that they maintain.

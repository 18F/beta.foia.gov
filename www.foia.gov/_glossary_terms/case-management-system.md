term: "Case management system"
---

A system (usually electronic) to track the workflow of individual FOIA
requests (cases). Each agency can have their own case management system
they use to triage, assign, track, and fulfill requests. Agencies may use
case management systems for as much or as little of the FOIA fulfillment
process as they wish.

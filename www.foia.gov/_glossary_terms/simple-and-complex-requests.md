term: "Simple and complex requests"
---

Many agencies classify FOIA requests as either simple or complex in order to more efficiently process them and respond to you through separate queues.  Agencies place requests in these tracks based on the amount of work or time involved in processing the request.  The factors that make a request complex may differ from agency to agency depending on the unique nature of that agency’s records and record systems, but you can reach out to FOIA personnel at the agency  to learn how your request might be classified. Agencies also provide average and median processing times for both types of requests–you can access that information on the “Reports” page of FOIA.gov or by calling the FOIA personnel at the agency your request is being sent to.  By tailoring your request to fit within an agency’s simple track you will be able to get a quicker response from the agency.  
Examples of factors that determine whether your request is complex or simple include:
<ul>
<li>Whether the records requested are voluminous;</li> 
<li>Whether separate offices or locations must be searched in order to locate the records;</li>
<li>Whether the records require consultations with other agencies or multiple components within an agency.  Agencies engage in consultations when the records involve or have the equities of other agencies or agency components.;</li> 
<li>Whether the records include commercial or financial records of an entity outside the government which requires providing that entity an opportunity to object to disclosure.</li>
</ul>

term: "PII"
---

Personally Identifiable Information. Information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individualâ€™s identity,
either alone or when combined with other personal or identifying information
that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.
The definition of PII is often context specific and requires a case-by-case
assessment. Sometimes when combined with other information, non-PII can become
PII.

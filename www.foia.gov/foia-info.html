          <h1>FOIA.gov and FOIA Information</h1>
          <p>FOIA.gov is a project of the U.S. Department of Justice, and like all federal agencies, the Department of Justice is required under the FOIA to disclose records which are requested by any person unless those records are protected from disclosure.</p>
<p>Each federal agency is responsible for meeting its FOIA responsibilities for its own records. A list of <a href="report-makerequest.html">Principal FOIA Contacts At Federal Agencies</a> is available                 from this site. Likewise, each Department of Justice component                 is responsible for processing FOIA requests for the records that                 it maintains. Consult the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foia_guide09.htm"> DOJ FOIA Reference                 Guide</a> and the <a href="http://www.justice.gov/oip/foiacontact/">List of Individual DOJ Components and FOIA Contacts</a> if you                 plan to make a FOIA request to the Department of Justice. Before making a FOIA request, you should first browse <a href="http://www.justice.gov/02organizations/index.html">About DOJ</a>,            <a href="http://www.justice.gov/briefing-room.html">Briefing Room</a>, <a href="http://www.justice.gov/05publications/05_3_a.html">Reports &amp; Publications</a> of the main DOJ website, and
            each component&rsquo;s <a href="report-makerequest.html">FOIA Library</a> (formerly known as an &ldquo;electronic
            Reading Room,&rdquo; which is a part of each component&rsquo;s FOIA website),
          which contain information already available to the public.</p>

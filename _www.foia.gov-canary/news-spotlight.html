		<p>The Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve System along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation recently made available the public portions of resolution plans for 116 financial institutions.  As part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, bank holding companies (and foreign companies treated as bank holding companies) with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, as well as nonbank financial companies designated for enhanced supervision, are required to periodically submit resolution plans to the agencies.  These plans describe the strategy of each institution for a rapid and order resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company.</p>

<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released a new atlas and catalog of the entire infrared sky, capping off a project that began over 14 years ago.  Using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), astronomers were able to capture images of nearly a half-billion objects, such as planets, stars and galaxies that make up our universe.  NASA has combined the individual images taken by the WISE project and put them into 18,000 images, which are currently available to the public.  The entire atlas represents one of the clearest images of our universe to date.</p>

    <h3><a href="http://vault.fbi.gov/Howard%20Zinn">FBI Releases File on Howard Zinn</a></h3>
    <p>In 1949, the FBI opened a domestic security investigation on Howard Zinn (FBI File # 100-360217). The Bureau noted Zinn&apos;s activities in what were called Communist Front Groups and received informant reports that Zinn was an active member of the CPUSA; Zinn denied ever being a member when he was questioned by agents in the 1950s. In the 1960s, the Bureau took another look at Zinn on account of his criticism of the FBI&apos;s civil rights investigations. Further investigation was made when Zinn traveled to North Vietnam with Daniel Berrigan as an anti-war activist. The investigation ended in 1974, and no further investigation into Zinn or his activities was made by the FBI.</p>
    <p>On   July 30, 2010, the FBI released one file with three sections totaling   423 pages on Zinn, who died January 27, 2010 at the age of 87.</p>

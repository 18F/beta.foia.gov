  <p>
    openFOIA will no longer be available as of September 30th, 2017.  Weâ€™re
    working with the Office of Information Policy at the Department of Justice to
    build the National FOIA Portal as required by the FOIA Improvement Act of
    2016. You can follow along with our work on our <a href="https://github.com/18F/beta.foia.gov">Github repository</a>.
    The new National FOIA Portal will offer new features as well as resources made
    available on openFOIA and <a href="https://www.foia.gov">FOIA.gov</a>. In the
    meantime, please visit <a href="https://www.foia.gov">FOIA.gov</a> to find
    information on how or where to submit your FOIA request.

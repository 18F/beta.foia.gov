    term: 'Agency',
    definition: `
      Before making a request it’s important that you identify the correct agency where your request should be sent. The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is administered on a decentralized basis, meaning each of over 100 agencies is responsible for receiving, processing, and responding to its own FOIA requests. The resources on this website are designed to assist you in this process. Please note that FOIA only applies to Federal Executive Branch Agencies.  It does not apply to the Judicial Branch (Courts) or the Legislative Branch (Congress).`,

    definition: `
      A requester may qualify for expedited processing of their FOIA request if they can demonstrate a “compelling need” for the records.  A “compelling need” can be shown  by:  (1) establishing that the  failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis “could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;” or, (2) if the requester is a “person primarily engaged in  disseminating information,” by demonstrating that there exists an “urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.”  Agencies may also establish additional criteria for granting expedited processing, which they describe in their FOIA regulations.

    {
    term: 'Decentralized agencies or decentralized FOIA process',
    definition: `
      When an agency is separated into components or offices that each receive and respond to FOIA requests for their own records, the FOIA process is called “decentralized.” Most large federal agencies have a decentralized FOIA process, where requesters send their requests directly to the component or office of the agency that maintains the records they seek, and that component handles the request.

    term: 'Exclusions',
    definition: `
      Congress excluded from the FOIA’s requirements three narrowly defined categories of law enforcement records where  publicly acknowledging the existence of the records could cause harm to law enforcement or national security interests.  The first exclusion protects against disclosure of a pending criminal law enforcement investigation where there is reason to believe that the target is unaware of the investigation and disclosure of its existence could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The second exclusion, which applies only to records maintained by criminal law enforcement agencies, protects against disclosure of unacknowledged, confidential informants. The third exclusion, which applies only to the FBI, protects against disclosure of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism records, when the existence of those records is classified.
`,
  },
  
  {
    term: 'Exemptions',
    definition: `
      Congress established nine categories of information that are not required to be released in response to a FOIA request because release would be harmful to a governmental or private interest. These categories are called “exemptions” from disclosure and protect for example, personal privacy, privileged communications, and law enforcement interests.

  },
  
  
  {
    term: 'Expedited processing',
    definition: `
      Agencies generally process requests on a first-in, first-out basis.  Most agencies also utilize separate tracks to process simple and complex requests.  Under certain circumstances, your request may qualify for placement into a separate, expedited track where the agency will process it as soon as practicable.  The standards for expedited processing are set out in the FOIA and in the regulations of each federal agency.  Under the FOIA, a requester may qualify for expedited processing if they can demonstrate a “compelling need” for the records.  A “compelling need” can be shown  by:  (1) establishing that the  failure to obtain the records on an expedited basis “could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;” or, (2) if the requester is a “person primarily engaged in  disseminating information,” by demonstrating that there exists an “urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.”  Agencies may also establish additional criteria for granting expedited processing, which they describe in their FOIA regulations.  Requesters must demonstrate how they meet one of the standards in order to have their request processed on an expedited basis.
`,
  },
  
  {
    term: 'Fee waiver',
    definition: `
      Most FOIA requests do not involve any fees.  However, if an agency informs you that there are fees associated with your request, you may request a fee waiver under the standard provided in the FOIA.  You may request a fee waiver at any time during the processing of your request.  The agency will grant a fee waiver when disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations and activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.  Requests for fee waivers from individuals who are seeking records pertaining to themselves usually do not meet this standard.  Additionally, a requester's inability to pay fees is not a legal basis for granting a fee waiver.  When making a request for a fee waiver you must explain how your request meets the standard described above.

      Since 1967 the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/oip/legacy/2014/07/23/amended-foia-redlined-2010.pdf">Freedom of Information Act</a> (FOIA) has provided the public with access to federal agency records.   It is often described as the law that keeps citizens “in the know” about their government. The FOIA requires agencies to proactively post online certain categories of records and it provides the public with the right to request access to records from any federal agency.  For any record subject to the FOIA, federal agencies are required to disclose the record except to the extent that it contains information that is protected from disclosure by one of the FOIA’s nine exemptions that protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement.

Requesters can make a request to any agency subject to the FOIA using FOIA.gov.

   {
    term: 'Simple and complex requests',
    definition: `
      Many agencies classify FOIA requests as either simple or complex in order to more efficiently process them and respond to you through separate queues.  Agencies place requests in these tracks based on the amount of work or time involved in processing the request.  The factors that make a request complex may differ from agency to agency depending on the unique nature of that agency’s records and record systems, but you can reach out to FOIA personnel at the agency  to learn how your request might be classified. Agencies also provide average and median processing times for both types of requests–you can access that information on the “Reports” page of FOIA.gov or by calling the FOIA personnel at the agency your request is being sent to.  By tailoring your request to fit within an agency’s simple track you will be able to get a quicker response from the agency.  
Examples of factors that determine whether your request is complex or simple include:
<ul>
  <li>Whether the records requested are voluminous;</li> 
  <li>Whether separate offices or locations must be searched in order to locate the records;</li>
  <li>Whether the records require consultations with other agencies or multiple components within an agency.  Agencies engage in consultations when the records involve or have the equities of other agencies or agency components.;</li>

  {
    term: 'Unusual circumstances',
    definition: `
      When a FOIA request presents  “unusual circumstances” as defined by the FOIA, the agency can extend the 20 working-day response time.  Unusual circumstances occur when:  (1) the agency needs to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; (2) the agency needs to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or (3) the agency needs to consult with another agency or two or more components within its own agency.
